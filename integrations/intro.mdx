Enhance the capabilities of your Vida AI Phone Agent by integrating with various apps and services. We offer both native integrations and integrations via Zapier.

You can manage your integrations on the [Integration Settings Page](https://vida.io/inbox?settings=true&tab=integrations) in the Vida web and mobile apps.

## Native Integrations

### Google Calendar

Integrate your Google Calendar to allow your AI agent to check for conflicts when scheduling appointments. This ensures that your availability is accurately reflected, preventing double bookings and missed appointments.

### Cox Auto XTime

Cox Auto's XTime is the most used maintenance scheduling system by US auto dealerships. Enable this integration to allow your Vida AI agent to schedule and manage maintenance appointments for your customers over calls, sms, and emails. Email help@vida.inc if you are a dealership and would like to enable this integration via an enterprise subscription.

### Supported Zapier Triggers and Actions

- **New Conversations**: Triggers when a new conversation is completed. This allows you to take action based on the full details of the conversation.
- **Incoming Conversations**: Triggers before your agent responds to a new conversation. This enables you to prepare or log incoming communication in real-time.
