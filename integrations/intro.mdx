Enhance the capabilities of your Vida AI Phone Agent by integrating with various apps and services. We offer both native integrations and integrations via Zapier.

## Native Integrations

### Google Calendar

Integrate your Google Calendar to allow your AI agent to check for conflicts when scheduling appointments. This ensures that your availability is accurately reflected, preventing double bookings and missed appointments.

### Cox Auto XTime Maintenance Scheduling

Enable this integration to allow your AI agent to schedule and manage maintenance appointments through Cox Auto XTime. This integration ensures that your vehicle maintenance scheduling is handled efficiently.

## Zapier Integrations

Integrate your Vida AI Phone Agent with over 7000 apps via Zapier. This provides extensive possibilities to connect with popular CRMs, ticketing systems, and many other applications.

### Supported Zapier Triggers and Actions

- **New Conversations**: Triggers when a new conversation is completed. This allows you to take action based on the full details of the conversation.
- **Incoming Conversations**: Triggers before your agent responds to a new conversation. This enables you to prepare or log incoming communication in real-time.
