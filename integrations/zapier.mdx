### Supported Zapier Triggers and Actions

- **Agent Request**: Triggered by your AI agent. This allows your Agent to interact with any Zap in real-time during live conversations. Depends on a `Agent Response` action being configured in the Zap flow. [More info on the Zapier agent function here](https://vida.io/docs/functions/zapier).
- **New Contacts**: Triggers when a contact is added or updated. This makes it easy to sync contacts that your phone agent enriches to your CRM.
- **New Conversations**: Triggers when a new conversation is completed. This allows you to take action based on the full details of the conversation.
- **Incoming Conversations**: Triggers before your agent responds to a new conversation. This enables you to prepare or log incoming communication in real-time.
- **Inject Context**: Action to provide your AI agent with additional context about a caller. This can enhance the interaction by ensuring the agent has all necessary information.
- **Outbound Call**: Action that allows a Zap to initiate an outbound call from your AI agent.
- **Outbound SMS**: Action that allows a Zap to initiate an outbound SMS text message from your AI agent.
- **Agent Response**: Used in conjunction with the `Agent Request` trigger, this action let's you feed a Zap outcome or response back to your agent during a live conversation. [More info on the Zapier agent function here](https://vida.io/docs/functions/zapier).
