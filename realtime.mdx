We're excited to announce that you can now enable OpenAI's Realtime Speech-to-Speech API on your Vida AI phone agent. This feature allows your agent to engage in natural, fluid, and real-time conversations, providing a seamless communication experience. 

### Benefits of Enabling Realtime Speech-to-Speech

- **Enhanced Customer Experience**: With even lower latency voice responses, customers can interact with your agent as if speaking to a real person, leading to smoother and more engaging conversations.
- **Expressive and Emotional Range**: The API's advanced voice synthesis can express emotions, convey nuances, and even laugh, helping your agent respond more naturally and empathetically during interactions.
- **Language Flexibility**: This integration also supports automatically speaking in multiple languages, making it easier to communicate with a diverse audience.

### How to Enable Realtime Speech-to-Speech

We'll be enabling this option in the Agent Editor UI soon!
