---

The Vida platform supports exporting daily agent detail records to your external billing or rating platform over SFTP or FTP.

## Configuration

To configure ADR exports, speak with your Vida representative to configure this (configuration in your Partner or Reseller portal coming soon\!).\
\
Configuration requires the following specifications:

**Rotation Minutes:** How many minutes of records should be contained in each file (defaults to 60)\
**Transfer Protocol:** SFTP or FTP\
**Host:** IP Address or DNS name that resolves to the host you wish ADR files to be delivered to.\
**Port:** Port on your host for the transfer protocol\
**Username:** file transfer username\
**Password:** file transfer password\
**Path:** file path to deliver the ADR records to (defaults to "/" for default user directory)

## Export Frequency

The export process will begin shipping files to your destination server daily at 2am UTC time.

## File Name:

The files are named in the following format:\
ADR_accountId_YYYY_MM_DD_HHmmss.csv.gz

## CSV Format:

ADR Exports can be configured at the Partner, Reseller, or Organization level. The file format is slightly different depending on which level the export is created at. All fields are wrapped in double quotes.
