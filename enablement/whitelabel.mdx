Vida’s platform offers powerful white-label capabilities that allow resellers to deliver a fully branded experience for their customers. With flexible configurations, you can customize everything from domains and email settings to billing and mobile apps, ensuring your brand takes center stage.

## Key White-Label Features

### 1. **Customer App Domains**
Host the customer-facing interface under a domain you control. This ensures that your customers access the platform through a URL branded with your organization, enhancing trust and providing a consistent user experience.

### 2. **Customer Email Domains**
Your AI agents can send emails from your brand’s domain, reinforcing brand identity in every communication. Whether it’s transactional emails or outreach, messages will come from addresses like `agent@yourdomain.com`.

### 3. **Custom SIP Settings**
Apply custom SIP configurations across all your sub-organizations or customers. This flexibility ensures that SIP settings align with your specific infrastructure or operational needs.

### 4. **Bring Your Own Stripe Account**
Integrate your Stripe account to manage billing and payments. Vida handles the processing on your behalf, enabling you to charge and bill your customers seamlessly while maintaining control over the financial transactions.

### 5. **Bring Your Own Twilio Account**
If you prefer not to use Vida’s phone numbers, you can bring your own provider via Twilio. This lets you maintain consistency with your existing phone number setup and infrastructure while leveraging Vida’s powerful AI capabilities.

### 6. **Custom Branded Mobile Apps**
Deliver a generically branded mobile app to your customers. Vida can create white-label mobile apps without Vida’s branding, allowing you to provide a polished app experience under your own brand.
