description: "Overview of the Product Items supported on the Vida AI Enablement platform"
---

Vida's platform offers an extensive set of product items when building your product plans. This document will describe all product items that are supported and what they entail. 

The format of the product item uses a base category and children categories that further describe a type, direction, or specific vendor. Some product items may have only one category where others may have up to three. \
\
For example:\
\
**pstn-inbound-voice**\
"voice" = base category\
"inbound" = direction category\
"pstn" = child category to denote the voice call used the PSTN
