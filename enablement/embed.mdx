White-label resellers can leverage Vida AI’s embedding tools to integrate branded AI agents into their clients’ websites. This allows seamless interaction through calls or chats, providing an interactive and engaging user experience tailored to each client's brand.

## Embedding Overview

The embedding tools allow you to:
1. Embed AI agents into any website with a customizable interface.
2. Support both call and chat interactions directly from the client’s site.
3. Fully white-label the experience to align with your client’s branding.

### Example Embedding Code

Here’s an example code snippet for embedding an AI agent into a webpage:

data-target = the agent username you want to embed (required)
data-type = call or chat

```
<button className="customButton" data-vida-button data-target="vidasales" data-type="call">Call Us</button>
<button className="customButton" data-vida-button data-target="vidasales" data-type="chat">Chat Now</button>
<script src="https://vida.io/embed/button/v1/script.js" defer></script>
```

## Key Parameters for Resellers

data-target (Required): The Vida agent username assigned to the client’s agent. Ensure each client has their unique username configured.

data-type (Required): Specify call for initiating a phone call or chat for text-based interactions.

data-number (Optional): On mobile devices, this parameter can trigger dialing a phone number directly rather than using WebRTC. Example: data-number="+1234567890".

## Branding and Customization

### Custom Styling

You can override the default button styles to match your client’s brand using CSS.
```
.customButton { 
background-color: #0044cc; /* Client brand color */ 
color: #ffffff; 
border: none; 
padding: 10px 20px; 
font-size: 16px; 
border-radius: 5px; 
cursor: pointer; 
}

.customButton:hover { 
background-color: #002288; /* Hover state color */ 
}
```

- Manage their agent username.
