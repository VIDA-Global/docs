## Key Features of Usage Tracking and Management

### 1. **Hierarchical Usage Segmentation**
Vida’s platform segregates usage data at multiple levels, allowing detailed insights into every tier of your white-label ecosystem:

This flexibility allows you to cater to diverse customer requirements while maintaining control over costs and feature availability.

Resellers can access detailed usage breakdowns for every agent, organization, and account:
- View real-time and historical usage metrics to identify trends and optimize resource allocation.
