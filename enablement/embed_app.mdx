Partners can surface the full VIDA app inside their own domain with a single `<iframe>`. This enables secure auto-login, identity verification, and flexible signup flows without any custom backend work.

## Embedding Overview

With the iframe embed you can:

1. [Auto-login users via a one-time ](https://vida.io/docs/api-reference/authorization/generate-one-time-auth-token)`authToken`.
2. Verify user identity with the `email` parameter.
3. Redirect unauthenticated visitors into signup.
4. Pre-fill signup fields (business name, full name, contact number).
5. Customize messaging via the `custom` flag.

### Example Embed Code

```html
<iframe
  src="https://yourreseller.automatedphone.ai/app/embed?authToken=YOUR_TOKEN&email=user@example.com"
/>
```

## Required parameters

- `authToken` – one‑time authentication token used by the embed page to log the user in automatically. If omitted, the page logs the user out before rendering. [Read this page](https://vida.io/docs/api-reference/authorization/generate-one-time-auth-token) to learn how to get a one time authToken.
- `email` – the email that must match the authenticated user. If it does not match, the user is logged out. When the email changes, the user will be automtically logged out.

## Optional parameters

- `signup` – when present and the user is not authenticated, the embed redirects to the sign‑up flow.
- `customerId` – external customer identifier passed through to the sign‑up page.
- `businessName` – pre‑fill the business name on sign up.
- `fullName` – pre‑fill the user's name on sign up.
- `contactNumber` – pre‑fill the phone number on sign up.
- `custom` – allows alternate sign‑up messaging such as `answeringservice` or `createagent`.

Any combination of optional parameters may be included after the required `authToken` and `email`.

# Reseller Prefill via /app/embed

Resellers can prefill onboarding template fields and optionally skip steps by passing query parameters to `/app/embed`.

- All onboarding-related parameters must be prefixed with `onboarding_` to avoid collisions.
- Template fields: prefix with `onboarding_tf_` where suffix is the field key (e.g., `onboarding_tf_businessName`).
- Multi-select fields: pass repeated params or a comma-separated list.
- Validation: values are coerced to the correct type and validated against available options.
- Step skips: add separate boolean flags to skip steps without or alongside prefills:
  - `onboarding_skipTimezone=true`
  - `onboarding_skipAgentVoice=true`
  - `onboarding_skip_tf_<fieldKey>=true` to skip individual template fields
  - `onboarding_skip_ti_<integrationKey>=true` to skip individual template integrations

Examples
- `/app/embed?onboarding_tf_businessName=Acme%20Roofing`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_tf_industry=homeServices`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_tf_services=roofing&onboarding_tf_services=gutters`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_tf_services=roofing,gutters`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_timezone=America/New_York&onboarding_skipTimezone=true&onboarding_agentVoice=j5lwMohPvHJrfAM74bfG&onboarding_skipAgentVoice=true`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_skip_tf_businessName=true`
- `/app/embed?onboarding_skip_ti_googleCalendar=true`

Notes
- Prefills apply immediately if a template is already selected and persist through selecting a template.
- Skipped fields or steps require boolean flags; providing values alone does not skip.
- Unknown or invalid option values are ignored; valid values are applied.

## Summary

This guide explains how partners can embed the VIDA application on their own sites using a simple `<iframe>` integration. It covers the two required query parameters—authToken and email—for automatic user authentication and outlines several optional parameters to customize signup flows and pre-populate user data.
