To use the Vida API you need an API token. Get your token by going to Settings -> Developers in your Vida account. Note that using the Vida API requires a paid account, so you might need to upgrade first.

Once you have a paid account you can use the API page in Settings to create and manage your API tokens. You can also manage your SIP IP access lists.
