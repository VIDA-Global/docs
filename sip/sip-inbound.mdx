SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is the dominant protocol used globally for VoIP communications and Vida's AI agent platform natively supports inbound calls via SIP.

## Configuring your SIP IP Access List

Before your Vida agent will accept a call over SIP, you need to add your IPs to your SIP IP Access list. You can do this [via API](/api-reference/sip/list-sip-ip-whitelist) or via the [Settings -> Developer page](https://vida.io/app/inbox?filter=priority\&settings=true\&showOrgSettings=true\&settingsTab=developers) in your account.

All IPs you plan to send SIP INVITEs from need to be added in order for your agent to receive the call.

## Your Agent's SIP URI

Ever Vida agent has a SIP URI that can be used to send calls to your agent via SIP over the default port 5060. You can use your agent's username or it's phone number in the URI like below.

Username example: `sip:vidasales@sip.vida.dev`

Number example: `sip:+18335888432@sip.vida.dev`

Replace `vidasales` with your actual agent's username or `+18335888432` with your agent's phone number.

You can send SIP INVITEs to this URI from any VoIP PBX or softphone. Important Note: the SIP `From` header needs to be a valid phone number at this time. Sending anything else other than a valid e164 phone nunmber in the `From` header will result in a SIP 404.
