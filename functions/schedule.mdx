## Configuring the Schedule Function

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the scheduling function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should offer to schedule an appointment.
- **Email Recipients**: You can define additional emails (beyond the one associated with your account) that should receive the Calendar invitation event.
- **Rules**: Define any specific rules about when appointments can be scheduled. 

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a scheduling action:

```plaintext
- **Condition**: When the caller requests a consultation.
- **Email Recipients**: test@apple.come, fest@fun.org
- **Rules**: Schedule appointments only on weekdays between 10 AM and 4 PM.

- **Condition**: When the caller wants to book a follow-up meeting.
- **Email Recipients**: None.
- **Rules**: Check Google Calendar for conflicts before booking.
```

## Use Cases

Scheduling actions can be used in various scenarios:
- **Consultations**: Book consultation appointments, ensuring they do not conflict with existing calendar events.
- **Follow-Up Meetings**: Schedule follow-up meetings, taking into account your configured availability and calendar conflicts.
- **Service Appointments**: Book service appointments within specified time frames, ensuring efficient scheduling.

## Availability Configuration

The agent will take into account the Availability configured on your account. To configure availability, go to Settings -> Availability and set the days of the week and times during which booking is available.

## Enabling Google Calendar Integration

To enable Google Calendar integration for conflict checking, go to Settings -> Integrations and enable Google Calendar. This allows the agent to check for calendar conflicts before booking appointments.
