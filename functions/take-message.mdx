The Take a Message function allows your Vida AI phone agents to record voicemail or text messages from callers when specific staff members are unavailable. This ensures that important information is captured and relayed to the appropriate person for follow-up.

## Adding a Take a Message Function

To add a take a message function to your agent:
1. Log into your account and navigate to the agent editor.
2. Click the (+) button in the Functions section and select the "Take a Message" function.

## Configuring the Take a Message Function

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the take a message function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should send calls to voicemail or ask for text messages.

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a take a message function:

```plaintext
- **Condition**: When the caller requests to speak with a staff member who is currently unavailable.
- **Instructions**: Ask the caller to leave a message with their name, phone number, and the reason for their call. Inform them that their message will be relayed and someone will follow up shortly.
```

## Use Cases

Take a Message functions can be used in various scenarios:
- **Spam**: Tell your agent to send spam and solicitations to voicemail.
- **After Hours Calls**: Capture messages from callers when the business is closed.
- **Busy Staff Members**: Record messages when specific staff members are unavailable to take calls.
- **General Inquiries**: Allow callers to leave messages for general inquiries to be followed up on later.
