## Configuring the Call Transfer Action

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the call transfer function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should transfer the call.
- **Destination**: Provide the phone numbers to which the calls should be transferred. If no specific destination is configured, your agent will transfer to calls to you via the Vida mobile app if you have it installed.

## Supported destinations

Valid US phone numbers are supported, as well as usernames of other Vida AI agents. Post answer extention dialing is also supported via wait commas like `+15125551234,,,,,12". PSTN calling is only supported on paid accounts.

You can also tell your agent to route a call to you, and by default it will route to the Vida mobile app if no other destination is provided.

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a call transfer action:

```plaintext
- **Condition**: For sales inquiries.
- **Destination**: Transfer to Jim at +15125551234.

- **Condition**: For support escalations.
- **Destination**: Transfer to the support team at +17375551234,,,,3.
```

## Use Cases

Call Transfer actions can be used in various scenarios:
- **Sales Inquiries**: Direct sales-related calls to the sales team or specific sales personnel.
- **Support Escalations**: Transfer support-related calls to the appropriate support team members or departments.
- **General Inquiries**: Route general inquiries to the main office or a designated contact person.
