## Configuring the Call Transfer Action

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the call transfer function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should transfer the call.
- **Destination**: Provide the phone numbers to which the calls should be transferred. If no specific destination is configured, your agent will transfer to calls to you via the Vida mobile app if you have it installed.

## Action Settings
By clicking the gear icon, you are presented with more options for Call Transfer:
- **Use Agent Number For Call Transfers**: If set to Yes, when your agent forwards a call to your destination, the caller ID would be set to your agent's phone number. If set to No (default), the caller ID will be of the original person calling your agent. 

## Supported destinations

Valid US phone numbers are supported, as well as usernames of other Vida AI agents. Post answer extention dialing is also supported via wait commas like `+15125551234,,,,,12". PSTN calling is only supported on paid accounts.

You can also tell your agent to route a call to you, and by default it will route to the Vida mobile app if no other destination is provided.

## Special Features

You can tell your agent to speak information after a Transferred call successfully connects. This is useful if you are transfering to a customer support live agent and you want to summarize the information collected on the call with the Agent. You can simply ask your agent to use the `transferNotification` attribute to speak whatever information it has to the transferred caller.

## Transferring calls via a SIP Registration

Your agent can use your [SIP Registration](https://vida.io/docs/sip/sip-registration) via the transfer function to send calls out via your SIP registration so it can dial extensions and other internal destinations. You simply need to prepend `pbx:` or `ext:` to your transfer destination.

**Example instructions for having your agent transfer to an extension via the Registration:**

```
Please transfer all sales calls to ext:1002
Please transfer all support calls to ext:1005
```

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a call transfer action:

```plaintext
For sales inquiries, Transfer to Jim at +15125551234.

For support escalations, Transfer to the support team at +17375551234,,,,3. 

Important: Please include a summary of the problem to the transferred destination using the Transfer Notification attribute.
```

## Use Cases

Call Transfer actions can be used in various scenarios:
- **Sales Inquiries**: Direct sales-related calls to the sales team or specific sales personnel.
- **Support Escalations**: Transfer support-related calls to the appropriate support team members or departments.
- **General Inquiries**: Route general inquiries to the main office or a designated contact person.
