---

The **Post Convo** function lets your Vida AI agent run actions after a call or text conversation ends. Use it to finish tasks that should not interrupt the live experience, like syncing data to a CRM, triggering a webhook, sending a follow up SMS, or logging analytics.

This is useful when you want the agent to run a consistent end of conversation workflow, for example to store captured data in your CRM.

## When to use Post Convo

Use Post Convo to:
- Send conversation summaries or transcripts to external systems
- Create or update CRM contacts, leads, and activities
- Trigger ticket creation or task follow ups
- Send a thank you or next steps message
- Record analytics, tags, outcomes, and duration

## Add the Post Convo function

1. Log in and open the agent editor.
2. In the **Functions** section, click **(+)** and select **Post Convo**.

## Configure the Post Convo function

Write clear instructions that describe what the agent should do after every conversation ends. There are no runtime settings. The agent runs the instructions you provide.

Common actions:
- **Webhooks** Call your backend with conversation metadata, summary, and transcript links
- **CRM updates** Upsert contacts and attach the conversation summary or recording
- **Messaging** Send a follow up SMS or email with next steps or a scheduling link
- **Tasks** Create follow up tasks for callbacks or internal handoffs
- **Analytics** Log outcome, tags, duration, and other metrics

### Example configuration

```plaintext

   - Provide next steps or a resource link
