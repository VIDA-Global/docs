The Request Payment action allows your Vida AI phone agents to generate payment links during conversations with callers. This feature is essential for situations where a payment is required before a specific action or service can be performed. Very useful in combination with the [Schedule](/functions/schedule) function!

## Adding a Request Payment Action

To add a Request Payment action to your agent:
1. Log into your account and navigate to the agent editor.
2. Click the (+) button in the Functions section and select the "Request Payment" action.

## Configuring the Request Payment Action

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the request payment function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should request a payment.
- **Parameters**: Define the details needed for the payment request, including the amount, currency (default, usd, or btc), reason, and any additional metadata.

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a request payment action:

```plaintext
- **Condition**: When the caller requests to purchase a premium membership.
- **Parameters**:
  - **Amount**: "49.99"
  - **Currency**: "usd"

            "service_id": "vip123",
            "item": "[Item Name]"
        }

            "item": "[Item Name]"
        }
```

## Use Cases

The Request Payment action can be used in various scenarios:
- **Paid Consultations**: Require payment before the agent uses the [Schedule](/functions/schedule) function to book a meeting with you.
- **Premium Service Payments**: Collect payments for premium memberships, VIP services, or exclusive content.
- **Outstanding Balances**: Request payments for any outstanding balances or overdue invoices.
- **Event Registrations**: Charge for event registrations, bookings, or reservations.

## Webhooks

Vida can perform an HTTP POST request when payments to your agent occur. This is available via our [Zapier integration](/integrations/zapier) or by configuring your own [webhook via our API](/api-reference/webhooks/list-webhooks).

## Fees

Vida charges a 15% fee to the receiver of the payment. Be sure to include this in your price calculation. Vida may sometimes charge payers fees for using various payment types.

It is important to understand that people talking to your agent are buying "Vida Credit". Vida Credit can be used to pay any other Vida agent. Once received as payment, Vida Credit can be withdrawn via Paypal, Venmo, ACH, or Bitcoin Lightning. Vida Credit received via credit card payment has a withdrawal hold of at least 30 days to protect against fraud. All withdrawals are subject to Vida's [Terms of Service](https://vida.io/terms).

## Terms

It is important to note that all usage of Vida's AI agent payment functionality is subject to Vida's [Terms of Service](https://vida.io/terms). No illegal activity permitted. Vida reserves the right to deny withdrawal of Vida Credit. Vida Credit is like Robux (Roblox), Minecraft Coins (Minecraft), V-Bucks (Fortnite) or other digital goods. It is not like the cash in your wallet.
