---

The Notify function allows your Vida AI phone agents to send notification emails with transcripts and summaries of conversations they handle. This ensures you or your team receive detailed information about each call or message for further action or record-keeping. The Notify function is only run at the end of calls and/or conversations. Note that the Notify action is different from the [Send Email](/functions/send-email) function which allows your agent to send emails with any content or destination you instruct it to include.

## Adding a Notify Function

To add a notify function to your agent:
1. Log into your account and navigate to the agent editor.
2. Click the (+) button in the Functions section and select the "Notify" function.

## Configuring the Notify Function

Once added, you need to provide instructions to the agent on how and when to use the notify function. You will specify:
- **Conditions**: Describe under what conditions the agent should notify you.
- **Email Recipients**: Provide the email addresses where the summaries should be sent. By default, the email notification will be sent to the address on file for your account, but you can add additional email addresses.
- **Content**: Any specific information you want summarized in the notification.

### Example Instructions

Here is an example of how you might configure a notify function:

```plaintext
- **Condition**: When the agent completes a customer service call.
- **Email Recipients**: Send the email to support@company.com and manager@company.com.
- **Content**: Include a summary of the conversation, highlighting key points and any follow-up actions required.
```

## Use Cases

Notify functions can be used in various scenarios:
- **Customer Service**: Notify your team about customer service calls to the support team for follow-up.
- **Sales Leads**: Email notifications of sales inquiries to the sales team for immediate action.
- **Support Requests**: Forward details of technical support requests to the appropriate team or support queue (like Intercom) for resolution.
