Your Vida AI phone agent can be embedded into any website so your visitors can talk and interact with your Agent just like they would over the phone. 

Here is an example code that embeds a Vida AI phone agent into a web page:

```html
	<!-- 
	  -- data-target = the vida agent username you want to embed (required)
	  -- data-type = call or chat
	-->
	<button
    	className="vidaButton"
	    data-vida-button
	    data-target="vidasales"
	    data-type="call"
  	>
    	Call
  	</button>
  	<button
    	className="vidaButton"
	    data-vida-button
	    data-target="vidasales"
	    data-type="chat"
  	>
    	Chat
  	</button>
	<script src="https://vida.io/embed/button/v1/script.js" defer />
```

## Known issue with Embedded Agents

Due to new security policies, some browsers are implementing restrictions on Microphone access on third party scripts.

Here is the relevant documentation for allowing the permissions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/microphone

You have to set a header on your webserver to tell browsers that microphone access is allowed to our domain. You'll need to update the Permissions-Policy header to include our TURN and SIP signaling domains:
Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self "sip.vida.dev" "turn.vida.dev")
