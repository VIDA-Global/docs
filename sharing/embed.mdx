Your Vida AI phone agent can be embedded into any website so your visitors can talk and interact with your Agent just like they would over the phone. 

Here is an example code that embeds a Vida AI phone agent into a web page:

```html
	<!-- 
	  -- data-agent = the vida agent username you want to embed (required)
	  -- data-welcome = text that will be shown when hovering over the widget. Default: "Talk to our AI!"
	  -- data-size = "expanded" if you want the widget pre-expanded without needing hover
	-->
	<div 
	  id="webrtc-widget"
	  class="vida-webrtc-widget"
	  data-agent="vidasales"
	  data-welcome="Talk to our AI!"
	  data-size="normal"
	></div>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://vidapublic.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vida-webrtc-widget/index.css">
	<script src="https://vidapublic.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/vida-webrtc-widget/index.js"></script>
```

## Known issue with Embedded Agents

Due to new security policies, some browsers are implementing restrictions on Microphone access on third party scripts.

Here is the relevant documentation for allowing the permissions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/microphone

You have to set a header on your webserver to tell browsers that microphone access is allowed to our domain. You'll need to update the Permissions-Policy header to include our TURN and SIP signaling domains:
Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self "sip.vida.dev" "turn.vida.dev")
