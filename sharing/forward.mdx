Your Vida AI phone agent can work seamlessly with your existing phone service. Here are two ways to get calls flowing to your Vida AI agent quickly:

1. **Primary Business Number**:
   - For new businesses, use your Vida phone number as your primary contact number. Share this number directly with your customers on your website, business cards, and online profiles.

2. **Call Forwarding**:
   - If you already have a business or cellular phone number, you can use call forwarding to redirect calls to your Vida AI phone agent when you are unavailable or when the line is busy. 
   - To enable call forwarding on your existing business number, configure it in your business number's settings or directory. If you can't find the setting, reach out to your provider for support or reach out to us and we will help you.
