Here are two ways to get calls flowing to your Vida AI agent quickly:

1. **Primary Business Number**:
   - For new businesses, use your Vida phone number as your primary contact number. Share this number directly with your customers on your website, business cards, and online profiles.
2. **Call Forwarding**:
   - If you already have a business or cellular phone number, you can use call forwarding to redirect calls to your Vida AI phone agent when you are unavailable or when the line is busy.
   - To enable call forwarding on your existing business number, configure it in your business number's settings or directory. If you can't find the setting, reach out to your provider for support or reach out to us and we will help you.
   - **NOTE:** make sure that your calls are forwarded to Vida showing _the caller's_ caller ID, not your phone number.  This enabled Vida to track callers by their inbound caller ID.
3. **Conditional Call Forwarding (forward unanswered calls):**
   - You can also set your phone to forward calls conditionally, i.e. only those calls that you do not answer.  Instead of hitting voicemail, the phone call will be transferred to your agent.
   - **NOTE: **make sure that your calls are forwarded to Vida showing _the caller's_ caller ID, not your phone number.  This enabled Vida to track callers by their inbound caller ID.
   - **NOTE FOR iPHONE USERS: **Apple's "Live Voicemail" is a feature introduced in iOS 17 that provides real-time transcription of voicemails as they are being recorded.  However, when enabled, this feature makes it impossible to do Conditional Call Forwarding.  To ensure success, disable "Live Voicemail" when attempting to use Conditional Call Forwarding.
