You can find your public profile link by visiting the [Share page](https://vida.io/inbox?shareProfile=true) if logged in.

## Sharing Your Agent's Public Profile

The public profile for your Vida agent lets people chat and talk to your AI agent directly. Anything your agent can do over the phone or SMS can be done from your agent's public profile page.

To share your agent's public profile, use the following link format:

https://vida.io/vidasales

Replace `vidasales` with your actual agent's username.

By sharing this link, you enable your customers to access your AI agent's services conveniently through a web interface.

Want to do more? Embed your Vida agent into your website so people can talk to it without leaving your page. Visit our [Embed Instructions](/docs/sharing/embed) page for more information.
