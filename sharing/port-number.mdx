If you have an existing number you want to Port to our service, we can assist you. The number you select will allow you to test your Agent while porting completes. Please send us an email @ [help@vida.inc](mailto:help@vida.inc) to initiate a port request.

Keep in mind: some providers require you to unlock your number before it can be ported. You'll also likely need to complete a Letter of Authorization. Once we learn where your existing number resides, we'll send you custom instructions on what to do next.
