Welcome to the Vida API. We provide a RESTful API that allows you to access all the features and functionality of Vida. You can use our API to integrate your applications, services, and workflows with our platform.

# Authentication

To authenticate with the Vida API, you will need an API key. This key is a unique identifier for your account and is used to ensure that only authorized users have access to the data. 

## Obtaining Your API Key

Get one in Account -> Settings -> Developers. Requires a Paid account!

Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests to the Vida API. Include it in requests to our API as a URL parameter like so:

```http
?token={{your token}}
```
