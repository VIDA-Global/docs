The greeting option allows you to define what your agent should say when it answers the phone. This greeting also applies when people interact with your agent via its public profile through chat. A well-crafted greeting sets the tone for the interaction and ensures that your customers feel welcomed and understood.

### How to Configure the Greeting

To set up the greeting for your AI agent:
1. Navigate to the greeting settings in your Vida agent configuration.
2. Enter the desired greeting message.
3. Save your settings to apply the changes.

### Dynamic Prompt Driven Greetings

Prepending "prompt:" to your greeting will trigger your AI phone agent to come up with a dynamic greeting every call. You can feed in additional context in your prompt. This feature also works well with the `Pre-Answer` function for use-cases where you want to greet a caller by name via a CRM pre-answer lookup.

### Tips for Crafting an Effective Greeting

- **Introduce the Business**: Start by clearly stating the name of your business to let callers know they've reached the right place.
- **Introduce the Agent**: Provide the name of the agent or simply mention that it's an AI assistant to make the interaction feel more personal.
- **Offer Assistance**: Briefly state how the agent can help, whether it's answering questions, taking reservations, or providing information.
- **Keep it Short and Friendly**: A concise and friendly greeting helps set a positive tone for the conversation.
