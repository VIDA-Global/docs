The links option allows you to give your AI phone agent access to external information on the web. By providing URLs, you can give your agent the context it needs from sources like FAQ or product pages, ensuring it has the latest and most relevant information to assist your customers. Links to PDFs are also supported.

### How to Configure Links

To set up external links for your AI agent:
1. Navigate to the links settings in your Vida agent configuration.
2. Enter the URL of the webpage you want your agent to access.
3. Save your settings to apply the changes.

### Tips for Using Links Effectively

- **Relevant Sources**: Use URLs that contain frequently updated and accurate information relevant to your business, such as FAQ pages, product details, and service descriptions.
- **Specific Pages**: Link directly to the most pertinent pages rather than general websites. For example, link to a specific FAQ section rather than the homepage.
- **Regular Updates**: Periodically review and update the links to ensure the information remains current and accurate.
- **Test URLs**: Ensure the URLs are correct and accessible. Broken links can lead to your agent not being able to retrieve the necessary information.

### Sample Use Cases

- **FAQ Page**: Link to your companyâ€™s FAQ page to enable the agent to answer common customer questions.
- **Product Information**: Provide links to product pages so the agent can give detailed information about your offerings.
- **Support Articles**: Link to support articles to help customers troubleshoot common issues.

Keep in mind only 2 links per agent are supported right now. By configuring links, you can ensure that your AI agent is well-informed and capable of providing accurate and up-to-date information to your customers.
