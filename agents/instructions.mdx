The instructions tool lets you tell your agent what to do, who it is, what product it supports, how it is to handle customer interactions, and more. Think of it like an instructions document you give a new employee that would be answering your calls. Be specific and provide examples!

For best results, give your agent a persona and clearly defined goals. For examples of Instruction prompts for a variety of use-cases see our [examples section](/examples).

### Best Practices

- **Be Clear and Specific**: Provide detailed instructions to ensure the agent understands how to handle different scenarios.
- **Reflect Your Brand**: Make sure the agent’s personality and tone align with your brand identity.
- **Regular Updates**: Update the instructions regularly to keep the information current and accurate.
- **Test and Refine**: Continuously test the agent’s performance and refine the instructions based on feedback and observations.

By using the Instructions tool effectively, you can ensure that your AI agent provides high-quality, consistent, and efficient customer service.
