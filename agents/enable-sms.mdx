Due to new carrier rules and regulations, enabling SMS capabilities on your Vida AI phone agent requires that you register a "Brand" and "Campaign" with US carriers.

First you need to fill out a form with information about your business in your Vida account. Go here while logged in to complete the form: [Enable SMS Capabilities](https://vida.io/inbox?requestAccess=true)

### Next Steps

Once you've completed the SMS registration form it can take 1-2 weeks (depending on Carriers) for your SMS capabilities to active. You'll be kept in touch about the process via replies from our support team.

### Keep in mind

Keep in mind that US Carriers are cracking down on spam and abusive sms content sent over their networks. Make sure your agent is configured to respond properly as your Brand when it receives text messages.
