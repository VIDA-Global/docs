The language option in your Vida AI agent configuration allows you to select the language or languages your agent should be listening for. This is crucial as Vida uses a Speech-to-Text (STT) engine to understand and process spoken language accurately. 

### Available Language Options

Currently, you can choose from the following languages:
- **English - US**
- **Spanish - US**
- **Multilingual - English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Russian, Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, and Dutch**


### How to Configure the Language

To set the language for your AI agent:
1. Navigate to the language settings in your Vida agent configuration.
2. Select the desired language from the available options.
3. Save your settings to apply the changes.

### Important Note on TTS Voices

Please be aware that certain AI Text-to-Speech (TTS) voices are not available when Spanish or Multilingual is selected as the language. This means that while your agent can understand and process calls in other languages, the range of voices it can use to respond may be limited compared to when English is selected.

By carefully choosing the language setting, you can ensure that your AI agent understands and interacts with customers in the most effective manner for your business's needs.
